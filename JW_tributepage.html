          <h3 id="headline">A little about John Williams</h3>
    <p> John Williams has composed many iconic film scores, such as Harry Potter, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and JAWS to name a few.  After studying at Jullilard and the Eastman School of Music he returned to Los Angeles where he began working as an orchestrator at film studios. Williams has composed at least 124 film scores, and has been nominated for 193 awards! Out of those he has won 5 Academy Awards, 3 Emmy Awards, 4 Golden Globes, 25 Grammy Awards, 7 Bristish Academy Film Awards, and 8 Saturn Awards.
      <br><br>
      Williams got his knack for music from his father, Johnny Williams, a jazz drummer and percussionist who played with the Raymond Scott Quintet. Outside of Hollywood, Williams served as the Boston Pops' conductor from 1980 to 1993 and also orchestrated theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games and NBC Sunday Night Football.
      <br><br>
      Williams has three children with his late wife Barbara Ruick, and is currently married to Samantha Winslow.
