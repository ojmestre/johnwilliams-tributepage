# John Williams Tribute Page
A for-fun and for-practice John Williams tribute page


<h2> The Need </h2>
<p>
To curb my curiosity and answer the question: Just how many film scores has John Williams composed?
</p>

<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
I really love soundtrack music.  As a matter of fact, I have a Spotify playlist dedicated to it which contains 3,394 songs and 171 hours of music.  Listening to the playlist lets me relive the most epic parts of movies and television shows.  Over time I began to notice just how many tracks listed Williams as the composer. Being a fan of move and TV soundtracks, I knew Williams was quite accomplished, but I was still curious - just how many movies has he composed for?  After some basic internet research I realized just how accomplished John Williams.  He is the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT) when it comes to film score composition.
