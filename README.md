# John Williams Tribute Page
A for-fun and for-practice John Williams tribute page, because he is the greatest of all time when it comes to soundtrack music!

<h2> The Need </h2>
<p>
To curb my curiosity and answer the question: just how many films has John Willimas composed for? 
</p>

<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
I really love listening to soundtrack music.  As a matter of fact, I have a whole playlist of it on Spotify which contains 3,394 songs and 171 hours of music.  Listening to the playlist lets me relive the most epic parts of movies and television shows. Over time, I realized that John Williams was the composer for way more tracks than I realized, so I decided to do a bit more digging.  That led to some basic internet research and subsequently a realization that John Williams is incredibly accomplished in the subject of film scores.

<h2> The Benefits </h2>
<p>
Now I know just how accomplished John Williams is and this information can be a great conversation piece or just some cool fun facts to thrown down.
